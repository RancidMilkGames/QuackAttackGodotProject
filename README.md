# Quack Attack â€” A CC0 Sample Project for Godot 4

A CC0 Godot 4 project. The game is more meant to illustrate common game implementations, such as a save system, autoloads, etc. While there are comments throughout the code, I ran out of time to do a little documentation before the jam's end. I plan to update the project with that soon. I hope it helps someone with some aspect of learning Godot. Whether it's in structure, a specific system, or something entirely else.

I also would be happy to share the project under a permissive open source license if for some reason you object to CC0. Please note that this is a Godot project, which doesn't contain source code for Godot or any of its third party components. There's a precedent of CC0 projects in Godot's official asset library, which makes me comfortable in releasing it this way. Enjoy!
